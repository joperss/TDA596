Regarding deadlocks and inconsistencies during concurrent read and writes:
We had some discussion with Ioannis about what would happen if we did read and
writes concurrently. This could result in duplicate entries if a vessel
belonging to the write-quorum did a read while another vessel did a write. We
worked around this by doing a non-blocking lock upon receiving a GET request
(using the same lock as we would use if the vessel was being locked remotely). This lock is normally only used on the vessels in the write-quorum, which means that the remaining vessels would behave as before (doing a read upon a GET request). The vessels in the write-quorum are at most one message behind, which means a GET request to a vessel will return the most recent version or the second most recent version.
