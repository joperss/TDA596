Comments on Leader election implementation:
When a vessel has sent its conf-message it dosen't bother to pass forward other vessels
conf and elect message. With the assumption that all connection are reliable, we feel that this 
is the most reasonable way to handle it. Other vessels will still receive our conf message and pick that leader.
